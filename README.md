## Understanding Serverless Functions 

### Evolution of Serverless Functions

- Used to have manage everything. Bare metal, to code, and so on.
- Virtualization and Hypervisors - Allowed running of multiple OS's on one machine.
- The Cloud - Amazon EC2 - Logical extension of virtualization. Renting of virtualization. Got to manage virtual machines, rather than physical ones.
- Serverless Functions - You as a developer do not think as much, about the servers running code. 
  - Event driven, responding to some event (file upload, api request, etc.)
  - Code focused (not infastructure). Focus more on writing business logic, not the infastructure.
  - Run on managed machine! 
  - Focus on the code, none of the rest.
